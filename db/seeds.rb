# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# alex = User.create!({email: "alex@alex.com", password: "123456", first_name: "alex", last_name:"sell", bio: "i like dogs", dob: "01/01/1999", photo: "hello", postcode: "sl37tf"})
# homeless = Recipient.new({first_name:  "gio", last_name: "panininilessss", gender: "Male", dob: "01/01/1999", bio:"i like paninis", phone_number: "01784882933"})
# homeless.users = alex
# homeless.save
